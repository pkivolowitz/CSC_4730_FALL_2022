# CSC4730 - FALL 2022

This is the Fall 2022 presentation of CSC4730 by Prof. Perry Kivolowitz.

This term represents a change to the course in that we can no longer do
the projects students loved so much inside a real OS. 

Sad, but
"improvements" to xv6, `gcc` and `brew` renders it too difficult to
install a working environment. Take this as an example of the worst
aspects of Open Source Software - the idea of "build it yourself".

It's bull shit. It's unprofessional. It's sad.

Instead, projects in this course will all be created on the
command line of your own systems. On Windows, you must install
WSL - the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It's easy. It's great.
And learning the Linux command line is a marketable skill.
On the Mac, you'll just use the terminal.

## Syllabus

[Here](./syllabus/CSC%204730%20Fa22%20Kivolowitz.pdf) is the
syllabus.

Worthy of being highlighted, the attendance and lateness policy
contained in the syllabus reads:

```text
For every five classes missed, your final grade will be reduced by a
full letter. Absences due to sports, music, or any other campus activity
count as an unexcused absence. To be clear: A full letter grade means
exactly that. For example, a B+ will be reduced to a C+.

We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “leave early.”
Therefore, leaving a class early will be counted as a quarter class
missed. 

We meet for 65 minutes. There is little room to “arrive late.”
Therefore, arriving late to a class will be counted as a quarter class
missed.
```

## xv6

[Here](./xv6/README.md) is information about downloading xv6.

Even though you won't use this source code for projects, we will
use it for discussion - so download and unzip it.

Personally, I
would study this code, every line, to deeply learn OS implementation
and down-n-dirty programming. I did (well, the original v6 which
was new when I started). Look at me know.

## Helpful Quickies

[Here](./pptx/) are some small Powerpoint slide decks I
made in the past. I do not lecture from Powerpoint but
these might explain somethings quickly.

## Your Projects

[Here](./projects/) are the projects. A number of these
are already uploaded. If you think you can tackle them
in advance, knock yourself out.
