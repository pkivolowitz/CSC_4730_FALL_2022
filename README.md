# xv6 Projects Are Kaput

Coding parts of an actual OS were a major part of this course. "Improvements"
in `gcc`, `qemu`, and xv6 itself have rendered it too difficult to use any
longer. I am truly sad about this.

While we cannot write parts of an OS any longer, you must still download
the source code to xv6 as we can still use it for exploration. The source
code can be found
[here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/agf1im2b2khfbty/xv6.zip)

Unzip this into its own folder.
